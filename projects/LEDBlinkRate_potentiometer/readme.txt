Wiring

Connect the middle pin of the potentiometer to one of the ADC (Analog-to-Digital Converter) pins on the ESP32 (e.g., GPIO 34).

Connect one of the outer pins of the potentiometer to 3.3V.

Connect the other outer pin of the potentiometer to GND.

Connect the LED anode (long leg) to a digital pin on the ESP32 (e.g., GPIO 23) through a current-limiting resistor (220Î©).

Connect the LED cathode (short leg) to GND.
